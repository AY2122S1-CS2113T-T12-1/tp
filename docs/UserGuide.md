## Features 

## Notes about command format
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` represent the parameters to be supplied by user. Below we have a list of parameters
  that we would be referring to throughout this user guide.
    * `DATE` represents the date specified by the user in `YYYY MM DD` format.
    * `SENTIMENT` represents the public's opinion towards an instrument. It can only take 3 different values: 
  `positive`, `neutral` or `negative`.
    * `REMARKS` represents the remarks specified by the user.
    * `INDEX` represents the index value of an instrument. The index value would correspond to the instrument's
      position in the list.
      * For example the first instrument in the list would have an index value of 1 while 
      the 3rd instrument in the list would have a
  value of 3.
* Extraneous parameters for commands `list` and `bye` would be ignored.
    * For example the command `bye 123`
      would be interpreted as `bye`.

## Adding a new instrument: `add`
Adds a new instrument to your watchlist of instruments. 

Format: `add`

Upon typing the `add` command, an instruction prompt below would be displayed to guide you through the process of
adding a new instrument.

```
mTracker$> add
	Please key in the type of instrument: 
```

MTracker currently supports 4 different types of instruments.
The 4 types are `stock`, `etf`, `crypto` and `forex`. 

### Adding a new `stock`
The addition of a new stock expects 4 parameters.
* `Name` Name of the stock. Empty name is not allowed.
* `Current price` Current price of the stock. Requires a positive number.
* `Sentiment` Sentiment of the stock.
* `Remarks` Any additional optional remarks about the stock.

Example usage
```
mTracker$> add
	Please key in the type of instrument: 
mTracker$> stock
	Name of stock: 
mTracker$> IBM
	Current Price: 
mTracker$> 144.61
	Sentiment for instrument: 
mTracker$> positive
	Remarks (optional): 
mTracker$> 
```

By following the instructions above, a new stock would be added and an acknowledgement message would appear.
Following the usage example above we would see the following message:
```
	[S]IBM
```

Note: If any of the non-optional parameters `Name`, `Current price` and `Sentiment` are provided with invalid
inputs, you would be prompted to give a valid input.

### Editing an instrument: `edit`
Edit an existing instrument.

Format: `edit`

Upon entering the command, a sequence of prompts would be displayed.
1. Enter the instrument index.
2. Choose the parameter to edit.
