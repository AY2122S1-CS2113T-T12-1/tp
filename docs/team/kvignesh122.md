##Project Overview: mTracker

mTracker is a **CLI-based trading journal** that allows
investors and traders to store and view important trading related information on their
shortlisted financial instruments. The program allows users to store
information on 4 types of instruments: Stock, ETF, Forex, Cryptocurrency.

mTracker is written in Java 11 and contains over 5000 LoC.

These are my contributions to the project:

- Project was divided among group members based on the various instruments.
I was mainly in charge of implementing all forex-related classes and testing.
- Implemented the find feature, which allows users to search for 
instruments saved in the watchlist using their input search term.
- Was instrumental in beautifying the UI. Coded the ACSII patterns
for bye, and mTracker logo at startup.
- Made sure that error messages were consistent in formatting with fullstops 
and commas. Also made sure grammar is correct for the error messages, and UG due to 
  my strength in language.
- Coded the main run method in MTracker class and also the bye command for exiting
program.
